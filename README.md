Favorite Places is a Flutter app that allows you to keep track of your favorite locations! Take a picture of a place that is special to you and add it's location either through your current location or mark it on the map. That way you can always revisit those memories through accessing your saved places. This code was produced during the completion of the Flutter course [A Complete Guide to the Flutter SDK & Flutter Framework for building native iOS and Android apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/learn/lecture/37130436#overview).
